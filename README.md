This is a java project which is a bmi calculator ,where we have used some gui i,e swing so that it looks more attractive , this project can be considered as an miniproject college students can show them in end of the graduation or at IV sem.
How to use it:-
  1:-Firstly to know how the project looks like you can simply download and run the .jar file in your system you can use launch 4j or simply download any java IDE. preferable is Eclipse.
2:-if you want the code of the project you can see the two .txt files b1 and b2 this text file contains the java code of the project you can simply copy that code or open it into eclipse or any other IDE.
Dependencies:-
    1:- I have attached some .jpg images these are the icons that are used inside the project so for these dependencies use the following process:-
        a:- firstly in Eclipse create a project called BMI.
        b:-then create two j-frames and copy b1 and b2 code to them.
       c:- in the Src folder ( created by default, in which two j-frames will be created) create a folder named image and simply add all the images to that folder.
(PLEASE HAVE LOOK TO example.png  FOR THE IDEA).

3:- if you want to skip these steps you can simply download the .jar file and show them to anyone ( but needs a jar file runner).
